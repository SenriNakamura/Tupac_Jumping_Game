Still I Rise is an online jumping game inspired by Tupac Shakur and the TUPIT program.  
You climb upward through an endless tower of platforms, collect good items, avoid harmful ones, and “rise” as far as possible. The game blends platformer mechanics with visual symbolism drawn from themes of resilience and social barriers.

This project is built in **React + TypeScript + Vite**, with custom SVG assets, dynamic platform generation, and game physics engineered for smooth and responsive gameplay.
